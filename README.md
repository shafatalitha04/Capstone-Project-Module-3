In the banking industry, effective marketing strategies are crucial for customer acquisition. 
However, traditional marketing campaigns often result in high costs and low conversion rates due to poor targeting. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their profile and past interactions with marketing campaigns.

Using a stacking classifier, this model balances the trade-off between identifying potential depositors and minimizing marketing costs. The project involves:
✔ Data preprocessing (feature encoding, scaling, and transformation)
✔ Model selection & hyperparameter tuning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and CatBoost)
✔ Evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
✔ Model deployment & usage

By leveraging machine learning, the bank can improve marketing efficiency, reduce unnecessary outreach, and maximize conversion rates.
